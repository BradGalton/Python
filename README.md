# Python Projects

Scripts adapted from CS 190.1X Scalable Machine Learning course labs at U.C. BerkeleyX. Problem formulation and datasets provided by instructors. Self-generated Python/PySpark code blocks begin with # TODO:

1) CTR LogLoss: Logisitcal regression analysis on click-thru-rate effectiveness of Criteo Labs dataset from Kaggel competition. 

2) PCA Neural: PCA dimensionality reduction of neural activity in zebra fish from light-sheet microscopy data by Ahrens Lab.

3) NASA Logs: Parsing of NASA web server log data and various analytical measures of interest.

4) MillionSong LinReg: Linear regression of normalized features to predict song year from Million Song dataset from UCI Machine Learning Lab.
